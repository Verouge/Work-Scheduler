# Work Scheduler

## Mission:

This is a basic calendar app designed for the average workday (9amâ€“5pm), enabling users to store events for every hour. The application functions in a web browser and incorporates jQuery to facilitate real-time updates of HTML and CSS elements.

## Objective:

The objective is to develop a daily planner application that allows users to create and manage their schedules effectively. The application should display the current day at the top of the calendar, provide time blocks for standard business hours, color-code the time blocks to indicate past, present, and future, allow users to enter events in the time blocks, save the events in local storage upon clicking the save button, and ensure that the saved events persist even after page refresh.

## Criteria Selection:

1. Display of Current Day: The application should prominently display the current day at the top of the calendar.
2. Time Blocks: The time blocks for standard business hours (9am to 5pm) should be presented when the user scrolls down.
3. Color-coded Time Blocks: Each time block should be color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
4. Event Creation: Users should be able to click into a time block to enter an event.
5. Event Saving: Upon clicking the save button for a time block, the text for that event should be saved in local storage.
6. Persistent Event Storage: The saved events should persist even after page refresh.

## Validation:

1. Testing: Perform functional testing to verify that the current day is correctly displayed, time blocks are generated for the specified hours, and the color-coding accurately reflects the past, present, and future time.
2. Usability Testing: Conduct user testing to confirm that users can easily enter events in the time blocks and save them.
3. Local Storage Testing: Validate that the events are successfully saved in the local storage and remain intact after refreshing the page.
